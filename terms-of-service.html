      <h1>What the commands do;</h1><p>As most commands are built for moderation, you can expect them to be rather strick and sometimes punishing. These commands are set in place to help you moderate your server and make it eaiser to do so. As these commands are rather strick some can permanently do something to a member. Ex. Baning a member from your server. Other commands can just simply add a role to a user. </p>
